### Partial Correlation

Neurocognitive z-scores of specific neuroclinical domains were correlated with Abnormal White Matteer across the subject groups using Pearson correlation. 
Adjusted for prednisone therapy (mg/day) and SLEDAI as partial correlations.

By adjusting with partial correlation no statistically significant correlation were found.
