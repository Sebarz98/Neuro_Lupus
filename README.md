# Neuro_Lupus
Investigating Systemic Lupus Erythematosus effects on volumetric brain MRI.

# Preliminary Analysis

#### Distributions were checked for normality and homogenity
#### Statistical significance has been evaluated for a p-value < 0.05

## Parametric Tests

### T-Test
T-Test between NP-SLE and not was conducted amongst mri features, as normally distributed. 
Amidst the statistically relevant regions found: 'Amygdala total volume %', OpIFG total volume cm3', 'MFC left volume %', 'SMC volume asymmetry', 'Occipital left volume cm3','SOG total thickness mm', 'OCP left thickness norm.', 'AIns thickness asymmetry'.

### Chi-Square

Chi-Square test was conducted on AnAb and aPL, but was not statistically significant

## Non Parametric Tests

### Welch T-test

By groupying based on NP-SLE, clinical statistically significant variables were:['aPL syndrome', 'AnAb ', 'Anti-Rib-P']

### Wilcoxon rank-sum test

Was conducted to compare continuous mri variables among groups based on NP-SLE 
Many were found to be statistically significant, the 5 most were plotted.

### Fisherâ€™s exact 

Was conducted to compare categorical variables among groups based on NP-SLE and AnAb:
Odds ratio: 7.00; P-value: 0.0461

### Partial Correlation

Neurocognitive z-scores of specific neuroclinical domains were correlated with Abnormal White Matteer across the subject groups using Pearson correlation. 
Adjusted for prednisone therapy (mg/day) and SLEDAI as partial correlations.

By adjusting with partial correlation no statistically significant correlation were found.
